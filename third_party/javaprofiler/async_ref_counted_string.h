// A string wrapper which uses string interning to store only one copy of a
// string.
// Init() must be called before any usage and the internal storage allocated by
// Init() will intentionally leak.
// The methods that are safe to call in a signal handler, are explicitly marked
// with "async-signal-safe".
// An underlying string table helps maintain only one copy per string to reduce
// memory overhead and speed up equality checking. Different
// AsyncRefCountedString instances owned by different threads do not need extra
// synchronization even if they refer to the same string. However, users have to
// provide their own synchronization to access the same AsyncRefCountedString
// instance from different threads. String interning cannot be achieved only by
// std::shared_ptr<string> since an additional associative array is needed to
// look up a string's intern. Combining a hashtable, std::shared_ptr<string> can
// only de-allocate itself if not needed and will not remove it from the
// hashtable. Furthermore, a sampling interrupt can happen when
// std::shared_ptr<string> is being copied and destructed, and the interrupt
// routine may see corrupted data. In other words, std::shared_ptr<string> is
// not async-signal-safe and thus not used.
